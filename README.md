# Custom Mean, Median, and Mode Calculations in R

This repository contains R code that calculates the **mean**, **median**, and **mode** of a given numeric dataset without using external libraries. The custom functions are designed to provide a clear, educational implementation of basic statistical calculations.

## Features

- **Mean Calculation**: The average value of the dataset is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of elements.
- **Median Calculation**: The middle value of a sorted dataset. If the dataset has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values.
- **Mode Calculation**: The most frequent value in the dataset.

## Files

- **`manual_calculate_mean_median_modus.R`**: The R script containing custom functions for calculating the mean, median, and mode.

## Functions Included

### Explanation of the `README.md`:

1. **Overview**: The introduction gives an overview of the repository, highlighting that the R code calculates basic statistics without using external libraries.
  
2. **Features**: Lists the three main functions (mean, median, and mode calculations) and provides a brief description of each.

3. **File Information**: Explains the contents of the repository, focusing on the `statistics_calculation.R` file where the functions are defined.

4. **Usage Instructions**: Step-by-step instructions on how to clone the repository, use the functions, and run the code in R or RStudio.

5. **Function Descriptions**: Each function (`custom_mean()`, `custom_median()`, and `custom_mode()`) is explained in detail, with the input and output parameters clearly described.

6. **Example Output**: Shows what the expected output looks like when running the code with a sample dataset.

7. **Contributing**: Encourages collaboration by allowing users to fork the repo and submit improvements via pull requests.

8. **License**: Includes a section on licensing (commonly required for open-source repositories on GitHub).

### How to Use This `README.md`:
